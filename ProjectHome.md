This is an AS3 library distilled from a few years work making commercial Flash applications.

It contains...

  * A very basic application framework (org.fatlib.app)
  * An asset loading, caching and retrieval system (org.fatlib.assets.AssetBank)
  * Graphic - an alternative to MovieClip (org.fatlib.display.Graphic)
  * A layout tool for dynamically loading and constructing layouts defined by XML (org.fatlib.app.LayoutManager)
  * A simple 3D engine (org.fatlib.fat3d)... although probably redundant after flash 10
  * A process model (org.fatlib.process) that allows sequencing and caching of commands, callbacks or asynchronous processes
  * A bunch of other useful utilities (org.fatlib.utils) eg.
    * A simple tween tool (org.fatlib.utils.Tween)
    * A delay object (org.fatlib.utils.Delay)

The download includes a basic app demo. More demos coming soon.
